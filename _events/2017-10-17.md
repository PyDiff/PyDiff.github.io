This is a talk that I will be giving at [PyconUK](http://2017.pyconuk.org/) 2017, 
http://2017.pyconuk.org/sessions/talks/a-trip-to-earth-science-with-python-as-a-companion/

Earthquakes are a natural phenomenon which occurs from the sudden release 
of energy in the Earth's lithosphere that creates seismic waves. Or put more
 simply, an earthquake is the shaking of the surface of the Earth!

As a mathematician I have always considered earth science to be an intriguing 
field though I was never given the opportunity to ‘dig’ around.

In July 2017, an earthquake hit my hometown on the island of Kos. The 
phenomenon was reported as a catastrophe due to the casualties and the 
damages the island took. But the event itself and my lack of information on it 
managed to spark my interest and as a researcher I decided to take a trip to 
earth science.

All a good traveller needs is a map and a companion. With open research being
my map all that was left was to wisely choose a trustworthy companion. After 
my inner software developer made a very good argument I decided to chose the
programming language Python!

I am proposing to tell the tale of how a life experience started a trip to learning
about seismology. Moreover, how Python and how the active community (libraries)
that come with it allow you to carry the weight of the travel. I will be 
showing how different libraries such as earthquakes and quakefeeds allow you 
to collect records from around the world collected from the United States 
Geological Survey. These records include properties of the earthquakes such as 
distance, gap, magnitude and depth. Moreover, I will be using the toolkit 
basemap to create maps and plot the geographical datasets that have been 
collected.

My proposal is to describe how Python allowed me to retrieve enough knowledge
to understand, visualise and express an opinion on something that was unknown
to me several months ago.
