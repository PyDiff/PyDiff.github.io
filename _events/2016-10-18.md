# Queues, Queueing and Ciw: Superpowers for Animators!

Animating can be a very time consuming process, with animators working on
feature films taking weeks to animate just a few seconds of footage. But we
will see that with the right tools and just a few lines of Python we can very
easily generate hours of background animation in minutes!

[Blender](www.blender.org) is a free and open source 3D animation package that
exposes much of its functionality through a Python API.

[Ciw](http://ciw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a Python library that
allows us to easily model and simulate networks of queues.

# Location
