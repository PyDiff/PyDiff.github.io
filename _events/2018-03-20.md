Bitcoin and other Blockchain based technologies have gained a lot of attention from the media over the last 18 months.
This talk will provide an introduction to how a basic Blockchain operates and we will attempt to create our own in Python.
No knowledge of Bitcoin or Blockchains is required and only basic Python will be used.
