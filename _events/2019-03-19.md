Anvil is a platform for rapidly developing web apps using nothing but Python. It
has a drag-and-drop editor for constructing a User Interface, controlled by
Python code in both the client and a hosted server environment.

This is an interactive workshop where you'll be guided through creating an app.
Either:

- A TODO list - a simple example of a Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) app
- A weather data dashboard
- An app that controls a remote machine from the web
- Any other idea you might have!

For a preview, have a look at this short video https://anvil.works/#about

All attendees will need to bring a laptop.
