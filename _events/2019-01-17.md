# Lightning talks

PyDiff is a regular lightning talk meetup. Speakers will:

- Form a queue;
- Use the (strict) five minute limit to speak about anything that you feel might
  be of interest to the crowd (it doesnâ€™t actually have to be Python related).

Feel free to come along just to listen or contribute to the session itself by
giving a lightning talk. The PyDiff attendees create a friendly and informal
atmosphere, a lightning talk is a great way to give your first talk.

Lightning talks are a regular occurrence at PyCons and are often the highlight!
