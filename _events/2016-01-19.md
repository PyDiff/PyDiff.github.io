# Edward Gomez - Robotic telescopes and world domination

Las Cumbres Observatory is a single scientific instrument spread out over 18 telescopes, operating in 7, global locations. We use python at almost every part in the operation; from the image data pipeline, observation scheduling, and the main observing web portal. I'll talk about what we use and hopefully give a live demo (we may have to sacrifice some internet kittens...).

# Lighting talks

A highlight of every python conference, we're going to have them at our meetup
:)
Prepare a 5 minute lightning talk about something that might be of interest to
the group :)
