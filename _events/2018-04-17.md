# Nothing but lightning talks!

We have a collection of lightning talks scheduled for this meetup but also
welcome any/all talks on the day:

- Form a queue;
- Use the (strict) five minute limit to speak about anything that you feel might
  be of interest to the crowd (it doesn't actually have to be Python related).

Lightning talks are a regular occurrence at PyCons and are often the highlight!

If you are thinking of giving a lightning talk let us know here (but it's also
OK to just turn up):
[github.com/PyDiff/PyDiff.github.io/issues/76](https://github.com/PyDiff/PyDiff.github.io/issues/76).
