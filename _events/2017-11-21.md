#[Alex Carney](https://twitter.com/alcarneyme): Pip install stylo.

Introducing my first Python package, stylo! It is a package which attempts to
provide a toolkit for creating images and animated sequences using a blend of
code and mathematics.

During this talk I will outline the main idea behind how images are created in
stylo and where the inspiration for this came from. Then I'll briefly discuss
some previous attempts at realising this idea and share some of my journey in
developing it. I will then finish by introducing you to the library,
demonstrate some of the core ideas and tell you where I hope to take it in the
future.
