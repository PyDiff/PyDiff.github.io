# Kristian Glass - The Book Of Armaments: Tools For Better Python

Kristian is a regular speaker at Python/Django events.

There are some brilliant tools out there to help you write Python,
be they for testing, linting, documentation or dependency management.
Know them, use them, let them help you.

[**Notes and write-up**](http://blog.doismellburning.co.uk/the-book-of-armaments-tools-for-better-python/)

# Girish Kumar - Using Python to help with landslides

In this talk we'll cover how python helped geologists at Cardiff University in
rescue efforts during recent landslide events (which are caused by earthquakes).
We'll also discuss how a research project turned into a near real-time web
application over the summer and all things related to that.

# Lighting talks

A highlight of every python conference, we're going to have them at our meetup
:)
Prepare a 5 minute lightning talk about something that might be of interest to
the group :)
