[Humphrey Sheil](https://twitter.com/humphreysheil) Deep Learning and Python: a brief journey

Deep Learning is arguably (and sometimes controversially) the most important development in software engineering in the last 30 years. Systems trained using deep learning frequently outperform their more classical Machine Learning equivalents in computer vision, language translation and processing, forecasting / prediction, classification and ranking problems and are now moving into domains previously thought immune to any form of automation.

And Deep Learning is inextricably intertwined with Python! Virtually all of Deep Learning is Python-based - PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Numpy, Pandas, scikit-learn and matplotlib are just some of the building blocks that enable coders to prototype and build exciting new solutions to problems.

Join me in a whistle-stop (1-hour or less) tour through Deep Learning in Python, using a worked example to illustrate concepts, ideas, pitfalls and best practices.
