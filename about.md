This is the website for PyDiff, the Cardiff based Python and Django user group. The group was formed after the successful [DjangoCon Europe](http://2015.djangocon.eu) in Cardiff in 2015.

We hold monthly meetups at which we have one or two longform talks on various topics, along with short lightning talks. All are welcome to attend our meetups whether you're a python ninja, a complete beginner, or just interested in coming along and seeing what we're up to. We welcome talks on a wide range of subjects, if you'd like to give a talk just get in touch!

This website, along with our twitter account [@Pydiff](https://twitter.com/PyDiff), will post meeting dates and general information for the group.
